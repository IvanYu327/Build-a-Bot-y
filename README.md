# Build-a-Bot-y
EngHack Quests 2021 submission for 18 hour Python challenge, winning first place!

Project description:
We all know that regular activity is important, for both our physical and mental health. With everyone stuck at home, maintaining an active lifestyle has become crucial. We know that staying accountable with your fitness goals and tracking your progress are some of the biggest barriers when it comes to achieving this habit.

This is why we chose to create Build a Bot-y, your personal fitness goal tracker. Why a Discord Bot? Rather than downloading a separate app, users can easily access and integrate Build a Bot-y on a platform theyâ€™re familiar with. In addition, the social environment on this platform can help to motivate users to stick to their fitness plans.
